<p>
Follow the instruction, I successfully add fluxbox, my favorite window manager,  to CDE's dtlogin menu ;).  But it seems that fluxbox-0.9.13 is not very stable, I compiled it using gcc and it crashed several times on my Solaris 10 x86 box.  After recomplied with cc, it performs better.  I am not sure whether the problem is caused by compiler.
