</div>

I have a female dog named _Diudiu_ (means "loss") who lives with us from August
2005 when she was just one month old. Unfortunately when my child turned 6
months old we feel too busy to take care her well so we decided to send her
back to her hometown, she is now happier because of the freedom she has in the
village.

> A loss may turn out to be a gain (Huainanzi).

Be happy, don't get angry.
